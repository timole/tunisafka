# Feature Specification: Daily Menu Scraper Caching

**Feature Branch**: `002-use-a-cache`  
**Created**: 2025-09-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "use a cache for the scraper. The scraper should be executed on daily basis only since the menus change once a day"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature is about implementing caching for the menu scraper
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: System (scraper), Users (viewing menus)
   ‚Üí Actions: Cache menu data, Serve cached data, Refresh daily
   ‚Üí Data: Menu information, Cache entries
   ‚Üí Constraints: Daily refresh cycle, Menu data changes once per day
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Cache persistence method: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: File-based, in-memory, or database storage?]
   ‚Üí Cache invalidation strategy: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Time-based only or also manual refresh?]
   ‚Üí Target response time: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Performance expectations for cached vs fresh data?]
   ‚Üí Fallback behavior: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What happens if cache fails or is corrupted?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: faster menu access with daily data freshness
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focuses on caching behavior and user experience
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Cache entries, Menu data, Scraping results
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties - needs clarification on implementation details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning after clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the Tunisafka food menu application, I want to quickly access today's menu information without waiting for slow scraping operations, while still ensuring the data is fresh and updated daily since restaurant menus change once per day.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the system has no cached data for today, **When** a user requests menu information, **Then** the system scrapes fresh data and serves it to the user while caching it for subsequent requests
2. **Given** the system has valid cached data for today, **When** a user requests menu information, **Then** the system serves the cached data immediately without performing a scraping operation
3. **Given** it's a new day and cached data is from yesterday, **When** a user requests menu information, **Then** the system scrapes fresh data for the new day and updates the cache
4. **Given** multiple users request menus simultaneously, **When** the cache is empty, **Then** only one scraping operation occurs and all users receive the same fresh data

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the scraping operation fails but cached data from yesterday exists?
- How does the system handle cache corruption or invalid cache data?
- What occurs when the source website is temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system behave during the day boundary transition (e.g., midnight)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST cache scraped menu data to avoid repeated scraping operations within the same day
- **FR-002**: System MUST serve cached menu data when available and valid for the current day
- **FR-003**: System MUST refresh cached data automatically when it's from a previous day
- **FR-004**: System MUST perform scraping operations only once per day under normal circumstances
- **FR-005**: System MUST determine cache validity based on calendar day boundaries [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: timezone handling for day boundaries?]
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide consistent menu data to all users within the same day
- **FR-007**: System MUST gracefully handle cache failures by falling back to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: scraping fresh data or serving stale cache?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent concurrent scraping operations when multiple users request data simultaneously
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain acceptable response times when serving cached data [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific performance targets?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Cache Entry**: Represents stored menu data with associated metadata (date, timestamp, validity status)
- **Menu Data**: The actual restaurant menu information that gets cached and served to users
- **Scraping Result**: Metadata about the scraping operation (success status, timestamp, data source)
