## Browser Compatibility Testing
**Validates**: FR-009

**Test Matrix**:
- ✅ Chrome (latest version)
- ✅ Firefox (latest version)  
- ✅ Safari (latest version)
- ✅ Edge (latest version)

**For each browser**:
1. Complete Scenarios 1-2 above
2. Verify visual layout is correct
3. Confirm all interactive elements work
4. Check for console errors

## Performance Validation

**Metrics to verify**:
- ✅ Menu loading time: < 3 seconds
- ✅ Random selection time: < 1 second
- ✅ Page load time: < 2 seconds
- ✅ Memory usage reasonable during normal operation

**Testing method**:
1. Use browser developer tools
2. Monitor network tab during menu loading
3. Check performance tab for selection speed
4. Verify no memory leaks during extended usage

## Integration Testing

### API Contract Validation
1. Open browser developer tools → Network tab
2. Load the application and observe API calls
3. Verify API responses match contract specification
4. Check error response formats during failure scenarios

**Expected API behavior**:
- ✅ GET /api/menus returns proper schema
- ✅ GET /api/menus/random returns proper schema
- ✅ Error responses include proper error codes
- ✅ CORS headers allow frontend requests

### Data Validation
1. Inspect actual menu data returned from API
2. Verify all required fields are present
3. Check data format matches specification
4. Confirm no malformed or missing data
