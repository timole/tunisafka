# Feature Specification: Tunisafka Food Menu App

**Feature Branch**: `001-tunisafka-app-shows`  
**Created**: 2025-09-18  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Tunisafka app shows food menus available at https://unisafka.fi/tty/. There is some kind of scraper that actually scrapes the data from the webpages then it shows the main base with a button which has a topic like select a random menu and when the user pushes the random menu button then the system will select a random menu"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a student or staff member at TTY (Tampere University of Technology), I want to view available food menus from the university cafeteria and get random menu suggestions so that I can decide what to eat without having to browse through all available options myself.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user opens the Tunisafka app, **When** the app loads, **Then** the system displays available food menus scraped from unisafka.fi/tty/
2. **Given** food menus are displayed, **When** the user clicks the "Select Random Menu" button, **Then** the system randomly selects and highlights one of the available menus
3. **Given** menu data is not available or outdated, **When** the user accesses the app, **Then** the system attempts to refresh menu data and displays appropriate status messages
4. **Given** multiple menu options are available, **When** the user clicks the random selection button multiple times, **Then** different menus are selected randomly each time

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the unisafka.fi website is unavailable or menu data cannot be scraped?
- How does the system handle when no menus are available for the current day?
- What occurs if the random selection is triggered when only one menu is available?
- How does the app behave when menu data is partially corrupted or incomplete?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST scrape and display current food menu data from https://unisafka.fi/tty/
- **FR-002**: System MUST present all available menus in a clear, readable format on the main interface
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a "Select Random Menu" button that is clearly visible and accessible
- **FR-004**: System MUST randomly select one menu from available options when the random selection button is activated
- **FR-005**: System MUST visually indicate which menu has been randomly selected (highlighting, emphasis, or similar visual cue)
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle scenarios where menu data is unavailable or cannot be retrieved
- **FR-007**: System MUST refresh menu data to ensure current information is displayed real-time
- **FR-008**: System MUST display appropriate loading states and error messages during data retrieval operations
- **FR-009**: System MUST be accessible to users using a standard web browser without accessibility requirements

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Menu**: Represents a food menu option available at the university cafeteria, containing menu name, description, prices, availability times, and any dietary information
- **Menu Item**: Individual food items within a menu, including item name, description, price, and dietary restrictions or allergen information
- **Scraping Session**: Represents a data collection event from the source website, tracking timestamp, success status, and retrieved menu count
